							<h2>Automation and Integration <strong>Enabling Organizitional Growth</strong></h2>

							<div class="section-entry">
								<p>By combining Twilio and Salesforce, JuviGap was able to fully automate a free SMS service that helps youth who are on probation of their court-ordered obligations. It reminds them of specific tasks that they have to accomplish to help them stay on track, and achieve successful probation outcomes. The product was so successful it allowed the .org to move from supporting 3 districts to supporting 13 districts in less than a year.</p>

								<p>With JuviGap, we made a mobile ready form with Ruby On Rails. Created middleware REST API in Salesforce.com to recieve the data from the Rails Application. Twilio was then integrated to send SMS messages. </p>

							<h3>Understanding <strong>the Data</strong></h3>

							<p>It takes a lot of understanding to get data in the right shape so that you can use visualization as part of data analysis. For example, if the data comes from social media content, you need to know who the user is in a general sense – such as a customer using a particular set of products – and understand what it is you’re trying to visualize out of the data. Without some sort of context, visualization tools are likely to be of less value to the user.</p>

							<hr />

							<h3>Addressing <strong>Data Quality</strong></h3>

							<p>Even if you can find and analyze data quickly and put it in the proper context for the audience that will be consuming the information, the value of data for decision-making purposes will be jeopardized if the data is not accurate or timely. This is a challenge with any data analysis, but when considering the volumes of information involved in big data projects, it becomes even more pronounced. Again, data visualization will only prove to be a valuable tool if the data quality is assured. To address this issue, companies need to have a data governance or information management process in place to ensure the data is clean. It’s always best to have a proactive method to address data quality issues so problems won’t arise later.</p>

							<hr />

							<h3>Displaying <strong>Meaningful Results</strong></h3>

							<p>Plotting points on a graph for analysis becomes difficult when dealing with extremely large amounts of information or a variety of categories of information. For example, imagine you have 10 billion rows of retail SKU data that you’re trying to compare. The user trying to view 10 billion plots on the screen will have a hard time seeing so many data points.</p>
